tafl-client
===========
This is a university project to build game
with a strong Human-computer interaction (HCI)
and a reliable game architecture
with a powerful artificial intelligence.

This is a talf game : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tafl_games
You can choose which variant you want to play.

Build
-----
To build tafl-client you need a proper version of git.

Init git submodules :
$ git submodule init # register git submodules in .git/config
$ git submodule update # clone/fetch and checkout submodules

With CMake, in-source build isn't a proper way to build,
it's why you should create a "build" directory and build from here:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make

This will build the tafl-client into the build directory.

Dependencies
------------
* OpenGL
* SDL2
